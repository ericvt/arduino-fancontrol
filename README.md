# arduino-fancontrol
Arduino controls relay, connected to fans, and turns off and on based on temperature.

## Needs
Arduino
Tinkerkit sheild 
Tinkerkit thermistor
Tinkerkit relay
Some way of connecting the high power to a fan going through relay.

## Setup
Attach tinkerkit sheild to Arduino
connect relay to pin 01 on the "Output" side
connect thermistor on pin I3 on the "Input" side

## Starting
Download the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or use the online (never used it before)
It is also on Microsoft Store, but not sure about Apple.

Download this repo

put the Tinkerkit folder in Documents\Arduino\libraries (if on windows)

Now open Relay.ino and send it to your arduino. it will now start. It is now possible to disconnect from your computer. you can connect the usb or the power to anything else as the arduino remembers.

If you want to see the temperature that the thermistor is recording, while on the arduino IDE, press CTRL + SHIFT + M. and it will bring up the serial monitor which tells you the temp.

## Setting the trigger temperature

Please edit Relay.ino changing line 14 and setting the number to whatever you want it to trigger (in f) (the relay/fan will trigger when hotter than the number you put)
